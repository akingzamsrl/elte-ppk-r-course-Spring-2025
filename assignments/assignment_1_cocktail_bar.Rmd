library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}

setwd("/Users/achillesisidore/Documents/StatProg/elte-ppk-r-course-Spring-2025/assignments")

# Set the file path
file_path <- "cocktail_data.tsv"
print(file_path)

# Read the TSV file
cocktail_data <- read.delim(file_path, header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# View the first few rows
head(cocktail_data)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

cocktail_data <- read.delim("cocktail_data.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Separate ingredients into multiple rows
cocktail_long <- cocktail_data %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>") %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4/>") %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\(\\s*\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\s*% abv\\s*\\)")) %>%  
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "^\\s*(\\d+\\s+)?\\d*/\\d+\\s*")) %>%  
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "^\\s*\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\s*")) %>%  
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "^(oz|ml|cl|parts?|dashes?|tsp)\\s*")) %>% 
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

view(cocktail_long)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
##Get unique ingredients in alphabetical order
ingredient_list <- cocktail_long %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  mutate(sort_key = tolower(ingredients)) %>%  
  arrange(sort_key) %>%
  select(ingredients)

view(ingredient_list)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
##Count number of unique ingredients
unique_ing <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  summarise(unique_count = n_distinct(ingredients))

view(unique_ing)

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
##Count occurrences of each ingredient
ingredient_count <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE)

view(ingredient_count)

##10th highest frequency
ten_high_freq <- ingredient_count %>%
  slice(10) %>%
  pull(n)

view(ten_high_freq)

#Include all ingredients with frequency >= that of the 10th
top_ingredients <- ingredient_count %>%
  filter(n >= ten_high_freq)

view(top_ingredients)



```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
##Count ingredients per cocktail
cocktail_ingredient_counts <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(num_ingredients = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

view(cocktail_ingredient_counts)

##Find the max number of ingredients
max_ingredient_count <- max(cocktail_ingredient_counts$num_ingredients)

view(max_ingredient_count)

##Filter cocktails with the max count
cocktails_with_most_ingredients <- cocktail_ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max_ingredient_count)

view(cocktails_with_most_ingredients)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}

##Count how many unique cocktails each ingredient appears in
ingredient_cocktail_counts <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients) %>%
  count(ingredients)

##Filter ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
rare_ingredients <- ingredient_cocktail_counts %>%
  filter(n == 1)

##Count of rare ingredients
num_rare_ingredients <- nrow(rare_ingredients)

view(num_rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

##Get ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients) %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%
  filter(n == 1)

##Join to original long data to find which cocktails use them
cocktails_with_rare_ingredient <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)

view(cocktails_with_rare_ingredient)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
##Identify rare ingredients (used in only one cocktail)
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients) %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%
  filter(n == 1)

##Get cocktails that contain rare ingredients
cocktails_with_rare <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)

##Filter out those cocktails to get the rest
cocktails_without_rare <- cocktail_long %>%
  distinct(name) %>%
  filter(!(name %in% cocktails_with_rare$name))

view(cocktails_without_rare)

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

##Create the bartender cheat sheet matrix
bartender_cheat_sheet <- cocktail_long %>%
  filter(ingredients != "") %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients) %>%
  mutate(value = "X") %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = ingredients,
    values_from = value,
    values_fill = list(value = "")
  )

print(bartender_cheat_sheet)
view(bartender_cheat_sheet)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
